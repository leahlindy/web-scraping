# web-scraping
In this project I am practicing webscraping.
Multiple websites are being scraped for specific information which are stored in lists:

- mars.nasa.gov/news
- jpl.nasa.gov
- Twitter
The data is then being loaded into a MongoDB unstructured database.


Tools used: Beautiful soup, selenium, HTML, MongoDB, Python
